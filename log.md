# 100 Days Of Code - Attempt 3 - Log

We're on Attempt 3, and I fully plan to go the distance with this one. No slacking!

I'm livestreaming this _entire_ thing on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/mindstormer619). Catch me on stream to say hi, ask questions, provide criticism (literally anything goes as long as it's constructive), and learn! üòÑ

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: 2020-11-26

**Progress:** Worked on the design approach for the core of Plutus.

**Thoughts:** I'm starting a new project, an expense manager Android app written in Kotlin, a language and environment I'm not completely comfortable with. I actually started some basic setup and code for this a few days prior, but I realized that I hit a roadblock with what I wanted to attempt pretty quickly. I figured that the best way to gain some direction was to plot out a basic user interaction for one of the core aspects of the app.

### Day 2: 2020-11-27

**Progress:** Implemented a regular expression parser for parsing incoming purchase/credit notification messages and extracting useful fields. The regex parser works on the basis of capture groups.

**Thoughts:** The initial implementation is going to be a bit unfriendly to the user, but it allows us to get off the ground quickly. I'll be using an interface which generalizes exactly how a Message Parser is implemented, so we can get more implementations of it later on and allow the user to select at runtime.

### Day 3: 2020-11-28

**Progress:** Today I chose to pause the project work and instead spend a couple of hours on [Kotlin Koans](https://play.kotlinlang.org/koans).

**Thoughts:** Since I'm (relatively) new to the nuances of Kotlin, I figured I could spend some time understanding the _innumerable_ language features, and some of its oddities. Kotlin is certainly a language for the experienced programmer.

Found some interesting information about the language, including the fact that SAM-lambda conversions (SAM = _Single Abstract Method_) only work on SAM interfaces, **not** SAM abstract classes.

### Day 4: 2020-11-29

**Progress:** Did another set of the Kotlin katas -- today's were specifically on Collections. After that, I spent a bit of time mapping out the next part of Project Plutus, the transaction mapping (which takes in a set of text components extracted from the message, and maps them to the Transaction object which is to be persisted.)

**Thoughts:** Kotlin has a _ton_ of different features for collections -- all sorts of operations on sorting, mapping, folding (basically `reduce`, except it starts with an initial value instead of the first element of the collection), max/min operations, the works. It's possible to reduce vast amounts of Java code to incredibly concise Kotlin.

Interesting thing I learnt: Java functions cannot be called from the Kotlin side using _named parameters_, because apparently the JVM bytecode is not guaranteed to preserve function parameter names.

### Day 5: 2020-11-30

**Progress:** Today I went over another leg of the Kotlin exercises (they call them Koans, but those aren't koans dangit), specifically the one around Properties. Struggled a bit with understanding Delegates, but I get it now. About precisely 1 hour of work.

**Thoughts:** I intended to do a bit more on the main project today, but having shifted to morning streams, I had to cut it off after an hour in order to start my regular work day. Hopefully from tomorrow I'll be able to wake up a bit earlier so I can go on for a bit longer. It's hard switching habits to that of a morning person üòÅ.

Delegates afforded the most amount of trouble for me. One thing I understood was that a delegate for a mutable property most likely needs to maintain some kind of internal state of its own. The topmost example given in the Kotlin documentation is _terrible_ for understanding how Delegate setters function, and should probably be changed. I'll think about adding in a PR for updating that.

### Day 6: 2020-12-01

**Progress:** Worked on another part of the design, which defines mappers for converting message components into the pieces which make up the transaction (like the amount, or the counterparty data). Also worked on refactoring some existing code -- I realized I could use interfaces for any classes that I hadn't yet defined.

**Thoughts:** It was an interesting stream since I got a new random person joining the stream, and I notice that I'm a lot more focused when I know I'm being watched üòÅ.

The limitation of using an interface as a class substitute (in order to code in that part of the implementation later) is that you can't force any _constructor behavior_. The same applies to abstract classes as neither of them have constructors in the first place. I ran into this issue with the `Money` class I was trying to implement, because I needed the behavior that limits the decimal scale to 2 at construction time.

Some interesting definitions: _Scale_ refers to the number of places after the decimal point, while _precision_ is the number of significant digits, or digits that matter (precision is counted in TOTAL, not just for the ones after the decimal point). 180.25 has precision 5 and scale 2, while the same number with precision 2 and scale 5 would be 1.80000E2 (I think).

### Day 7: 2020-12-02

**Progress:** Wrote what looks like _most_ of the rest of the code for the Thing-That-Generates-Transactions, which I've helpfully titled `TransactionGenerator` (until I can think of a better name I suppose). Also a bit more refactoring. The refactoring is really an ongoing thing, I guess I should stop mentioning it.

**Thoughts:** I was *really* sleepy this morning, and I guess it showed because I took twice as long to think about what I was trying to do than I normally do. It's hard to switch to being a morning person. Guess I still need practice.

I seem to be hitting some kind of mental roadblock with the path forward. Probably time to hit the iterative design pit stop again and work on refining my mental idea of the implementation.
