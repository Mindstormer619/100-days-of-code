**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Learnt and coded some flexbox CSS on www.flexboxdefense.com. Got to Level 9 today.

**Thoughts:** Flexboxes aren't too hard, but this tutorial probably isn't covering all of it. I'll need to know enough of it to implement an upcoming project.

### Day 2: January 5, 2017

_Skipped yesterday due to traveling the whole day._

**Today's Progress:** Finished flexboxdefense! Wasn't too hard overall. Also started on my new project, Ultimate Tic Tac Toe.

**Thoughts:** Okay, flexbox *definitely* is harder than flexboxdefense shows. Tried making a simple 3x3 grid using flexbox, failed miserably, ending up with something that looks nothing like a grid. Will check out [CSS Tricks' exhaustive guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) for more information tomorrow.

### Day 3: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Did something different today! Taught basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript at a college gamedev workshop. We're building (a simple version of) the Chrome dino game!

**Thoughts:** Teaching code is great fun. Also quite exhausting. Also wrote a crapton of other code today, but unfortunately those have to be in private repositories at the moment.

**Link to work:** Unfortunately, no links today. I'll add the link to the repo when it goes public. My anonymized contributions should be visible on my Github graph, however.

### Day 4: January 7, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Completed [Flexbox Froggy](http://flexboxfroggy.com). Also taught how to make a simple version of the [Chrome Dinosaur Game](https://gitlab.com/mindstormer619/chrome-dino) in a six-hour workshop at MEPCO-Schlenk Engineering College, Sivakasi - TN (India).

**Thoughts:** Even more teaching today! The workshop basically continued from the previous day, and concluded today. Pretty much totally exhausted, so I didn't have much time to learn much more about flexboxes. Flexbox Froggy contains a bit more stuff to it than Flexbox Defense does (see Day 1), so learnt more flex properties (`flex-flow`, `flex-wrap` and `align-content`). Also it contains twice the number of levels, so that's great.

Tomorrow I'm mostly free from commitments, so I'm planning on spending a lot more time working with flexboxes. Also gonna read those guides I've linked earlier.

### Day 5: January 8, 2017 (more like 9th, it's really late right now)

**Today's Progress:** Made that freakin flexbox grid I have been trying to make for SO LONG! Lots of trial-and-error later, I finally got *exactly* what I was looking to create today. 

**Thoughts:** Initially the whole thing was pretty hit-and-miss. I was trying a lot of stuff, and nothing was really looking the way I wanted it to, or used some weird hack that didn't exactly set things correctly. (Technically even now I'm using *one* weird hack, but if you know of a non-hacky way to make something look *square* using plain CSS, please let me know).

But now I think I'm getting the hang of it. And the whole thing's great fun now :smile:

**Link to work:**

I've quick-hosted the output [here](http://spider.nitt.edu/~darthsid/flextest).

The code is part of [this repository](https://github.com/Mindstormer619/ult-ttt) -- the commit is linked [here](https://github.com/Mindstormer619/ult-ttt/commit/5510ef706ea950e6397d31605fafa2fd22c75b06).

### Day 6: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Made a full Ultimate Tic Tac Toe grid using flexbox, completing that which I was halfway through yesterday. The grid now looks glorious:

![ULTIMATE TIC TAC TOEEEEEE!!!](http://i.imgur.com/esbh8wC.jpg)

Also more small changes on the server side of things. I'll be using socket.io websockets to communicate between the game players and the server.

**Thoughts:** Truth be told, there wasn't *that* much progress today. Heart was just not in it. Spent most of the day procrastinating over other stuff, so I'm pretty sure I could have finished a lot more in the time I took to do this today had I spent a little more time earlier reading up some prerequisites rather than just winging it along. Tomorrow will be a better day.

I'm pretty sure I'm getting the total hang of flexboxes though. They're super-neat.

A two-player game is a fairly complicated application. I'll have to spend some serious time planning how the client-server interaction works out and how I can minimize the amount of stuff that needs to be done on the server to keep it zipping through games.

**Link to work:** I merged the code back to master in a nice little squashed commit, so it's right at [this commit](ac1ea3d959f0e974dc482e63d854d1eec2b358d4) showing only the nice result and not the PITA trial-and-error I had to do to get here.

OSHIT I JUST REALIZED deleting the PR branch would make some of the previous links I've sent up here moot. I'll see what I can do about it.

### Day 7: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress:**
- Read about [JWT authenticated sockets](https://auth0.com/blog/auth-with-socket-io/) and played around with them a bit.
- Taught about basic relational database modeling and concepts during a two-hour seminar at my local college coding club.
- CRed (Code Reviewed) a bit of code from an ongoing project that some of us are working on.

**Thoughts:** Overall, a productive day for the most part. However I didn't have the time to advance my own projects much today. I seriously need to stop beginning working on these so late at night lol.

**Link to work:** I've got no links right now because the actual amount of written code at the end was virtually nil. Will put an update once I make the actual authenticated sockets for the UTTT game.

### Day 8: January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Fiddled around with getting Handlebars partials to work. They just did not. This took really long smh.

**Thoughts:** I've gotta start getting used to this. I mean it's not like this is the first time I'm coming across libraries that have cryptic documentation... but I tried way too long and something about this is just not making any sense and I'm beginning to wonder why what I'm doing is so complicated to accomplish when it really should not be.

The main problem I'm finding with Node is that (aside from being built on JavaScript which is fundamentally an absolute scum-of-the-earth language) many packages are expected to work with each other a lot but have extremely limited documentation on how you get that actually done. Take for example, express with sessions, socket.io with express (for which I literally had to look at another [*repository*](https://github.com/onedesign/express-socketio-tutorial) made by someone who complained about exactly the same thing), handlebars with express (the HBS documentation describes stuff using handlebars as a standalone frontend JS object, not as an express-integrated Node library)... the list goes on. (Wow I just noticed that all of those have Express in them. For something that's supposed to integrate with a lot of other stuff the number of working examples available is notoriously small.)

Most of the time, getting it to work is a trivial deal involving a couple lines of extra configuration. But the problem is _when that is not documented, the configuration **ceases** to be a trivial deal_. It becomes a much longer process of looking at online tutorials and examples and StackOverflow and asking fellow devs who've managed to get it work in the past.

This is getting ridiculous tbh. For those who might want to help, what I'm trying to do is really simple, which is include a handlebars partial within the main layout page (which contains the HTML `<head>` section), however the partial itself (containing a JS script) is defined in an inline fashion inside the `index.hbs` file. For more context, the commit is linked below.

**Link to work:** The commit is linked [here](https://github.com/Mindstormer619/ult-ttt/commit/531a0ce65eecd3f78cfcdcd6f07f53de7620768a). If you're good at Handlebars (especially in Express configurations), you're welcome to help. I'm [@Mindstormer619](https://twitter.com/Mindstormer619) on Twitter.

### Day 9: January 13, 2017

_Skipped yesterday due to illness._

**Today's Progress:** Made a working prototype of authenticated websockets on socket.io! _feelsgoodman.jpg_

**Thoughts:** This felt great. Development felt right for once after quite a while. Maybe I'm just not a frontend person lol.

I'm still trying to flesh out the details of the game itself, but at least the stuff I'm prototyping is actually working the way I expect it to. Though socket.io's documentation is not the *best* I've seen, it's workable at the least.

There'll soon be a point where I'll have to focus less on the code itself and more on the game architecture. Development will be slower on those days. Hopefully pseudocode counts in the 100DaysOfCode Challenge :smile:

About Handlebars... I have a friend who knows how to work with partials. Just waiting for a couple days for him to be available to help me with it. For now I don't intend to waste any more time fiddling around with something I only have a half-assed chance of getting to work.

**Link to work:** Commit linked [here](https://github.com/Mindstormer619/ult-ttt/commit/ecf5d1d7ffee966ba6fff57febe2028021420486). I also just started a channel on Telegram where I have automatic updates for the `ult-ttt` repository.

### Day 10: January 14, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Successfully made a blank WebGL canvas, unsuccessful attempt at putting a 2D object in there.

**Thoughts:** **_WOO CHALLENGE COMPLETION 10% ONE TENTH THERE WOOOOOOOOOOO_**

_Ahem._

Okay, WebGL is _difficult!_ There's so many _numbers_ and magic constants and weird abbreviated functions and scripts in other languages and graphics jargon and math and so many other weirdybits. This was totally unexpected. I thought I could break from UTTT and have a nice chill coding session doing some monkey-see-monkey-do from Mozilla's [MDN pages on WebGL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API/Tutorial) but nonononononoooo shit has just *got* to fail on me left right and center.

Heck I'm pretty sure I have exactly the same source code as their demo source... I pretty much put a two-pane view and checked them side-by-side and couldn't find anything wrong. But hey, their code works and mine... doesn't. Canvas remains as black as ever.

And all this effort to get a freakin white square on the screen. Add to that the fact that I understood only about 40% of what I was doing. Most of this flies over my head and the main issue seems to be that they assume you're familiar with OpenGL already (which I'm not, so it's more like *my* issue, but why would I blame myself amirite?)

I've had it with this. I'll look into more detailed WebGL tutorials later, when I feel up to it. Tomorrow, perhaps, I'll look into some libraries that will hopefully ease things up. Not really *looking* to learn graphics programming in depth at the moment, more like getting something specific to work... so a library will do.

**Link to work:** Commit linked [here](https://github.com/Mindstormer619/webgl-experiments/commit/332fdf875d618dcb535afc868313ec28a3ff351c). Most of the content is ditto from [this page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API/Tutorial/Adding_2D_content_to_a_WebGL_context) (in fact, I would argue that it's *all* the content, not just most of it. BUT IT IS NOT WORKING.)

### Day 11: January 15, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

Made a basic working threejs demo referenced in [threejs documentation](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#Manual/Introduction/Creating_a_scene). Also made a couple of modifications to ensure that I'm really understanding what I'm doing. Thankfully it worked.

**Thoughts:** Man, this is so much easier than raw WebGL code. It's beginning to look like I can use ThreeJS for the other WebGL project I have planned (which will also go up on my Github, worry you not).

Stellar documentation on that software right there. I'm a graphics programming noob but I still got virtually 100% of what I coded.

**Link to work:** Commit linked [here](https://github.com/Mindstormer619/webgl-experiments/commit/bda740acb3c19f8678864dc6cbad67be259dc4d0).
