**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Learnt and coded some flexbox CSS on www.flexboxdefense.com. Got to Level 9 today.

**Thoughts:** Flexboxes aren't too hard, but this tutorial probably isn't covering all of it. I'll need to know enough of it to implement an upcoming project.

### Day 2: January 5, 2017

_Skipped yesterday due to traveling the whole day._

**Today's Progress:** Finished flexboxdefense! Wasn't too hard overall. Also started on my new project, Ultimate Tic Tac Toe.

**Thoughts:** Okay, flexbox *definitely* is harder than flexboxdefense shows. Tried making a simple 3x3 grid using flexbox, failed miserably, ending up with something that looks nothing like a grid. Will check out [CSS Tricks' exhaustive guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) for more information tomorrow.

### Day 3: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Did something different today! Taught basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript at a college gamedev workshop. We're building (a simple version of) the Chrome dino game!

**Thoughts:** Teaching code is great fun. Also quite exhausting. Also wrote a crapton of other code today, but unfortunately those have to be in private repositories at the moment.

**Link to work:** Unfortunately, no links today. I'll add the link to the repo when it goes public. My anonymized contributions should be visible on my Github graph, however.

### Day 4: January 7, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Completed [Flexbox Froggy](http://flexboxfroggy.com). Also taught how to make a simple version of the [Chrome Dinosaur Game](https://gitlab.com/mindstormer619/chrome-dino) in a six-hour workshop at MEPCO-Schlenk Engineering College, Sivakasi - TN (India).

**Thoughts:** Even more teaching today! The workshop basically continued from the previous day, and concluded today. Pretty much totally exhausted, so I didn't have much time to learn much more about flexboxes. Flexbox Froggy contains a bit more stuff to it than Flexbox Defense does (see Day 1), so learnt more flex properties (`flex-flow`, `flex-wrap` and `align-content`). Also it contains twice the number of levels, so that's great.

Tomorrow I'm mostly free from commitments, so I'm planning on spending a lot more time working with flexboxes. Also gonna read those guides I've linked earlier.
