# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Learnt and coded some flexbox CSS on www.flexboxdefense.com. Got to Level 9 today.

**Thoughts:** Flexboxes aren't too hard, but this tutorial probably isn't covering all of it. I'll need to know enough of it to implement an upcoming project.
