##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Learnt and coded some flexbox CSS on www.flexboxdefense.com. Got to Level 9 today.

**Thoughts:** Flexboxes aren't too hard, but this tutorial probably isn't covering all of it. I'll need to know enough of it to implement an upcoming project.

### Day 2: January 5, 2017

_Skipped yesterday due to traveling the whole day._

**Today's Progress:** Finished flexboxdefense! Wasn't too hard overall. Also started on my new project, Ultimate Tic Tac Toe.

**Thoughts:** Okay, flexbox *definitely* is harder than flexboxdefense shows. Tried making a simple 3x3 grid using flexbox, failed miserably, ending up with something that looks nothing like a grid. Will check out [CSS Tricks' exhaustive guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) for more information tomorrow.

----

### Day 3: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Did something different today! Taught basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript at a college gamedev workshop. We're building (a simple version of) the Chrome dino game!

**Thoughts:** Teaching code is great fun. Also quite exhausting. Also wrote a crapton of other code today, but unfortunately those have to be in private repositories at the moment.

**Link to work:** Unfortunately, no links today. I'll add the link to the repo when it goes public. My anonymized contributions should be visible on my Github graph, however.

----

### Day 4: January 7, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Completed [Flexbox Froggy](http://flexboxfroggy.com). Also taught how to make a simple version of the [Chrome Dinosaur Game](https://gitlab.com/mindstormer619/chrome-dino) in a six-hour workshop at MEPCO-Schlenk Engineering College, Sivakasi - TN (India).

**Thoughts:** Even more teaching today! The workshop basically continued from the previous day, and concluded today. Pretty much totally exhausted, so I didn't have much time to learn much more about flexboxes. Flexbox Froggy contains a bit more stuff to it than Flexbox Defense does (see Day 1), so learnt more flex properties (`flex-flow`, `flex-wrap` and `align-content`). Also it contains twice the number of levels, so that's great.

Tomorrow I'm mostly free from commitments, so I'm planning on spending a lot more time working with flexboxes. Also gonna read those guides I've linked earlier.

### Day 5: January 8, 2017 (more like 9th, it's really late right now)

**Today's Progress:** Made that freakin flexbox grid I have been trying to make for SO LONG! Lots of trial-and-error later, I finally got *exactly* what I was looking to create today. 

**Thoughts:** Initially the whole thing was pretty hit-and-miss. I was trying a lot of stuff, and nothing was really looking the way I wanted it to, or used some weird hack that didn't exactly set things correctly. (Technically even now I'm using *one* weird hack, but if you know of a non-hacky way to make something look *square* using plain CSS, please let me know).

But now I think I'm getting the hang of it. And the whole thing's great fun now :smile:

**Link to work:**

I've quick-hosted the output [here](http://spider.nitt.edu/~darthsid/flextest).

The code is part of [this repository](https://github.com/Mindstormer619/ult-ttt) -- the commit is linked [here](https://github.com/Mindstormer619/ult-ttt/commit/5510ef706ea950e6397d31605fafa2fd22c75b06).

----

### Day 6: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Made a full Ultimate Tic Tac Toe grid using flexbox, completing that which I was halfway through yesterday. The grid now looks glorious:

![ULTIMATE TIC TAC TOEEEEEE!!!](http://i.imgur.com/esbh8wC.jpg)

Also more small changes on the server side of things. I'll be using socket.io websockets to communicate between the game players and the server.

**Thoughts:** Truth be told, there wasn't *that* much progress today. Heart was just not in it. Spent most of the day procrastinating over other stuff, so I'm pretty sure I could have finished a lot more in the time I took to do this today had I spent a little more time earlier reading up some prerequisites rather than just winging it along. Tomorrow will be a better day.

I'm pretty sure I'm getting the total hang of flexboxes though. They're super-neat.

A two-player game is a fairly complicated application. I'll have to spend some serious time planning how the client-server interaction works out and how I can minimize the amount of stuff that needs to be done on the server to keep it zipping through games.

**Link to work:** I merged the code back to master in a nice little squashed commit, so it's right at [this commit](ac1ea3d959f0e974dc482e63d854d1eec2b358d4) showing only the nice result and not the PITA trial-and-error I had to do to get here.

OSHIT I JUST REALIZED deleting the PR branch would make some of the previous links I've sent up here moot. I'll see what I can do about it.

----

### Day 7: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress:**
- Read about [JWT authenticated sockets](https://auth0.com/blog/auth-with-socket-io/) and played around with them a bit.
- Taught about basic relational database modeling and concepts during a two-hour seminar at my local college coding club.
- CRed (Code Reviewed) a bit of code from an ongoing project that some of us are working on.

**Thoughts:** Overall, a productive day for the most part. However I didn't have the time to advance my own projects much today. I seriously need to stop beginning working on these so late at night lol.

**Link to work:** I've got no links right now because the actual amount of written code at the end was virtually nil. Will put an update once I make the actual authenticated sockets for the UTTT game.

----

### Day 8: January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Fiddled around with getting Handlebars partials to work. They just did not. This took really long smh.

**Thoughts:** I've gotta start getting used to this. I mean it's not like this is the first time I'm coming across libraries that have cryptic documentation... but I tried way too long and something about this is just not making any sense and I'm beginning to wonder why what I'm doing is so complicated to accomplish when it really should not be.

The main problem I'm finding with Node is that (aside from being built on JavaScript which is fundamentally an absolute scum-of-the-earth language) many packages are expected to work with each other a lot but have extremely limited documentation on how you get that actually done. Take for example, express with sessions, socket.io with express (for which I literally had to look at another [*repository*](https://github.com/onedesign/express-socketio-tutorial) made by someone who complained about exactly the same thing), handlebars with express (the HBS documentation describes stuff using handlebars as a standalone frontend JS object, not as an express-integrated Node library)... the list goes on. (Wow I just noticed that all of those have Express in them. For something that's supposed to integrate with a lot of other stuff the number of working examples available is notoriously small.)

Most of the time, getting it to work is a trivial deal involving a couple lines of extra configuration. But the problem is _when that is not documented, the configuration **ceases** to be a trivial deal_. It becomes a much longer process of looking at online tutorials and examples and StackOverflow and asking fellow devs who've managed to get it work in the past.

This is getting ridiculous tbh. For those who might want to help, what I'm trying to do is really simple, which is include a handlebars partial within the main layout page (which contains the HTML `<head>` section), however the partial itself (containing a JS script) is defined in an inline fashion inside the `index.hbs` file. For more context, the commit is linked below.

**Link to work:** The commit is linked [here](https://github.com/Mindstormer619/ult-ttt/commit/531a0ce65eecd3f78cfcdcd6f07f53de7620768a). If you're good at Handlebars (especially in Express configurations), you're welcome to help. I'm [@Mindstormer619](https://twitter.com/Mindstormer619) on Twitter.

### Day 9: January 13, 2017

_Skipped yesterday due to illness._

**Today's Progress:** Made a working prototype of authenticated websockets on socket.io! _feelsgoodman.jpg_

**Thoughts:** This felt great. Development felt right for once after quite a while. Maybe I'm just not a frontend person lol.

I'm still trying to flesh out the details of the game itself, but at least the stuff I'm prototyping is actually working the way I expect it to. Though socket.io's documentation is not the *best* I've seen, it's workable at the least.

There'll soon be a point where I'll have to focus less on the code itself and more on the game architecture. Development will be slower on those days. Hopefully pseudocode counts in the 100DaysOfCode Challenge :smile:

About Handlebars... I have a friend who knows how to work with partials. Just waiting for a couple days for him to be available to help me with it. For now I don't intend to waste any more time fiddling around with something I only have a half-assed chance of getting to work.

**Link to work:** Commit linked [here](https://github.com/Mindstormer619/ult-ttt/commit/ecf5d1d7ffee966ba6fff57febe2028021420486). I also just started a channel on Telegram where I have automatic updates for the `ult-ttt` repository. Reach out to me on [@Mindstormer619](https://t.me/Mindstormer619) if you want in on the live notifications.

### Day 10: January 14, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Successfully made a blank WebGL canvas, unsuccessful attempt at putting a 2D object in there.

**Thoughts:** **_WOO CHALLENGE COMPLETION 10% ONE TENTH THERE WOOOOOOOOOOO_**

_Ahem._

Okay, WebGL is _difficult!_ There's so many _numbers_ and magic constants and weird abbreviated functions and scripts in other languages and graphics jargon and math and so many other weirdybits. This was totally unexpected. I thought I could break from UTTT and have a nice chill coding session doing some monkey-see-monkey-do from Mozilla's [MDN pages on WebGL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API/Tutorial) but nonononononoooo shit has just *got* to fail on me left right and center.

Heck I'm pretty sure I have exactly the same source code as their demo source... I pretty much put a two-pane view and checked them side-by-side and couldn't find anything wrong. But hey, their code works and mine... doesn't. Canvas remains as black as ever.

And all this effort to get a freakin white square on the screen. Add to that the fact that I understood only about 40% of what I was doing. Most of this flies over my head and the main issue seems to be that they assume you're familiar with OpenGL already (which I'm not, so it's more like *my* issue, but why would I blame myself amirite?)

I've had it with this. I'll look into more detailed WebGL tutorials later, when I feel up to it. Tomorrow, perhaps, I'll look into some libraries that will hopefully ease things up. Not really *looking* to learn graphics programming in depth at the moment, more like getting something specific to work... so a library will do.

**Link to work:** Commit linked [here](https://github.com/Mindstormer619/webgl-experiments/commit/332fdf875d618dcb535afc868313ec28a3ff351c). Most of the content is ditto from [this page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API/Tutorial/Adding_2D_content_to_a_WebGL_context) (in fact, I would argue that it's *all* the content, not just most of it. BUT IT IS NOT WORKING.)

----

### Day 11: January 15, 2017

**Today's Progress:**

Made a basic working threejs demo referenced in [threejs documentation](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#Manual/Introduction/Creating_a_scene). Also made a couple of modifications to ensure that I'm really understanding what I'm doing. Thankfully it worked.

**Thoughts:** Man, this is so much easier than raw WebGL code. It's beginning to look like I can use ThreeJS for the other WebGL project I have planned (which will also go up on my Github, worry you not).

Stellar documentation on that software right there. I'm a graphics programming noob but I still got virtually 100% of what I coded.

**Link to work:** Commit linked [here](https://github.com/Mindstormer619/webgl-experiments/commit/bda740acb3c19f8678864dc6cbad67be259dc4d0).

----

### Day 12: January 16, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Made a swinging mouse-controllable cylinder thingy using ThreeJS. Halfway there for the main project I'm aiming to complete!

**Thoughts:** This was fairly easy. I'm gonna spend some time reading more tutorials, docs and blogs to try and figure out exactly what goes into making ThreeJS models look exactly the way I want them to. Also there's physics to worry about, which I'll have to look into.

But yeah, today's work specifically was pretty damn simple. Hopefully I can get a full prototype of what I want to make ready by next week.

**Link to work:** Commit linked [here](https://github.com/Mindstormer619/webgl-experiments/commit/10a394ce40ddeee3e54fd8b70b8b3ad2f0c15744).

Here's what it looks like in action:

![Simple movable rod](http://i.imgur.com/mRfVwDU.jpg)

Yeah, I know, it looks like nothing much. The actual running thing is slightly more impressive :grin:

----

### Day 13: January 17, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Solved a problem from Reddit's [r/dailyprogrammer](https://reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer) instead of that usual project I'm working on. Good to change things up once in a while.

The question is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/5llkbj/2017012_challenge_298_easy_too_many_parentheses/).

**Thoughts:** This problem was... interesting. Not too difficult, but it's definitely not what I would call an "easy" problem, as the question maker has marked it. Spent a good half hour thinking about how to get at the solution and whiteboarding various approaches. Or probably I'm just not as good at it as others are.

![shrug](http://i.imgur.com/DGCDjV3.jpg)

I *am* really happy with the way I approached the problem though. In hindsight it still seems like the most logical way to tackle the problem, so that's that. I'll add an explanation readme to the solution gist sometime later.

**Link to work:** Solution is [in this gist](https://gist.github.com/Mindstormer619/5fc6c558138546fd90fc3c5bfdeec023). Hit me up directly if you want to discuss it. Would recommend tackling it without looking at the solution first.

----

### Day 14: January 25, 2017

I'm back after a _loooong_ break! My laptop hard disk met with a nice little dose of catastrophic failure and filesystem corruption, so here I am after several (quite fruitless) attempts at recovery, `chkdsk`ing and finally shredding all the HDD contents and installing a fresh Ubuntu image. Whew.

Technically this is Day 15: I *did* work on something on the night my HDD decided to die on me. But I don't exactly remember what it was, and I have a feeling it wasn't much, so I'm not counting it.

**Today's Progress:** Made some progress with the two-person socket communication that's instrumental for `ult-ttt` to work. It's nothing complete yet, but at least I have a clear picture of things moving ahead.

**Thoughts:** Today I spent a good deal of time rubberducking and whiteboarding stuff, and it helped immensely in clarifying my own thoughts about how to proceed. I've listed out (albeit a bit haphazardly) what I have on my general approach to this. The full thing isn't completely fleshed out yet, but that's just a matter of time.

**Link to work:** Gist linked here: [Two Person Socket code](https://gist.github.com/Mindstormer619/6bf5a2a9ca7a4f98da24712fb6512645). I'll commit and push it when it gets a bit more complete so I can actually test things.

----

### Day 15: January 27, 2017

Okay, I totally skipped yesterday. I have no excuse, I simply got caught up with other stuff and totally forgot about my code hour till it was way too late. I had a couple hours of coding done in the morning yesterday, but that's part of a project I consider "work" and not something that I personally *want* to do, so I'm not counting that. So yeah, I did skip a day for pretty much no reason. This will never happen again.

**Today's Progress:** Today I had simply *epic* progress. I completed a working two-person communication system using websockets! This feels so great.

**Thoughts:**

So yeah, I found that once I get into the swing of things, I can really get immersed in the process. Like I spent two entire hours on this without realizing it. Getting something to actually *work* gives you a great rush. I feel more pumped than I have anytime this whole week :)

*aside*

Shortly before I started today, I went on to find a good Pomodoro timer for Ubuntu. I had [Tomighty](http://tomighty.org/) installed on my previous system, but it turns out (to my great chagrin) that Tomighty is offered on Windows... and Mac. No Linux. Great. The only thing worse than switching OSes is not being able to find software that was on your previous OS. (Speaking of which, if someone can get me Notepad2-mod on Linux, I will be *extremely* thankful.)

The great thing is I finally found this: [Gnome Pomodoro Timer](http://gnomepomodoro.org/). This works fantastically... probably even better than Tomighty did. I really love the neat and clean visuals, and the general simplicity of the app (which was what attracted me to Tomighty in the first place). Also it's got a great bird-chirping thing going on when the timer is on which is really nice ambient music to sit and code to.

*/aside*

All right, back to the regularly scheduled update. Yesterday I felt pretty terrible about myself about totally forgetting to do this. I was pretty sure I had reached this nice habit-forming state now. I guess the tendency to do this late at night and the whole week that I missed due to my machine crapping out took their general toll and I just, well, forgot.

Well, at least to myself, I made it up today. Did quite a bit of proper prototyping and got a nice working two-person socket communication system. This system is instrumental to the Ultimate Tic Tac Toe game that I want to create. I need to clean up the code and make it usable, but hey, at least I know that the general principle works now, and I can go ahead with the actual system.

Again, I cannot overstate how great this felt. Just seeing the thing actually working after numerous different logs and debug sessions... it felt seriously great.

**Link to work:** Please do check it out! The commit is [here](https://github.com/Mindstormer619/ult-ttt/commit/46310a336855246b92479ac1cbff30e6b3620854). Or you could just go to https://github.com/Mindstormer619/ult-ttt and navigate to the `proto` branch. Do a normal `npm install` and run the server. You should be able to communicate between two different browser windows.

I'm gonna try embedding a video demo here below. Dunno if Github markdown supports embeds.

_Okay turns out it doesn't. The video demo link is [here](https://www.useloom.com/share/f9e94050e4dc11e6b14c091dee11d2d4)._

### Day 16: January 28, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Did some code-review and documentation work for a project today. Not too interesting, not quite complete, but it's necessary stuff.

**Thoughts:** This is part of an extensive refactor on a project I'm working on. Each time I work on refactoring codebases, I begin to get how much work it actually is. It's something that appears simple at the beginning, but actually isn't easy to measure with respect to how long it's gonna take to complete.

**Link to work:** Unfortunately it's in a private repository as of right now (and I haven't committed those changes yet, they're still very much in progress.) I'll post the update here after the repo goes public.

----

### Day 17: January 29, 2017

**Today's Progress:** More documentation and code reviewing. This can go on for a while; that project is a fairly large one. Also set up and played around with [autosub](https://github.com/agermanidis/autosub).

**Thoughts:** Got a nice solid two hours in today. Pomodoro timers are so darn useful.

I'm currently examining and documenting a database schema and associated models. Did you know that PHPMyAdmin has an excellent DB Designer tool that lets you visualize your database with all its fields and relations, and can also generate a one-click report of the entire thing? I didn't.

Databases are tricky things to refactor. Schema refactoring often means writing new migrations that maintain integrity of the existing data and don't cause any data to disappear. Also it gets trickier when there are more tables because you have to basically check every pair of tables for possible relationships (making it a quadratic-time check). Isn't gonna be too simple.

The autosub thing is for another project of mine (yes, that's a lot of projects. I have even more lined up lol). Today all I did was play around with it, by giving it some audio files that I recorded using [Audacity](http://www.audacityteam.org/). It did way better than I expected it to perform. Seriously fast too.

I fully intend to read and understand its source code over the coming week or so. Updates, as usual, will be here.

**Link to work:** Sadly, no link today as well. A lot of the stuff I do isn't always open-source because of other constraints. But okay, my proof-of-work is to be a matter of public record, so here's a screenshot of our issues page at the moment.

----

### Day 18: January 30, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked with figuring out and processing XML output from YouTube's timedtext automatic English captions. I think it worked :)

**Thoughts:** Using Python's XML processor wasn't too difficult. Most of the time went in examining the XML file and figuring out its structure so I could use what looked like it was useful out of it.

I took the output of this hilarious video: [STAR\_'s GTA: I Like Killing Jerma](https://youtu.be/dUWEnhDR-88).

This is for the same project as the autosub thing.

**Link to work:** Here's a screenshot of my final Python code and the XML file after quite a bit of tinkering:
