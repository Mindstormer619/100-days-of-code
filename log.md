**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Learnt and coded some flexbox CSS on www.flexboxdefense.com. Got to Level 9 today.

**Thoughts:** Flexboxes aren't too hard, but this tutorial probably isn't covering all of it. I'll need to know enough of it to implement an upcoming project.

### Day 2: January 5, 2017

_Skipped yesterday due to traveling the whole day._

**Today's Progress:** Finished flexboxdefense! Wasn't too hard overall. Also started on my new project, Ultimate Tic Tac Toe.

**Thoughts:** Okay, flexbox *definitely* is harder than flexboxdefense shows. Tried making a simple 3x3 grid using flexbox, failed miserably, ending up with something that looks nothing like a grid. Will check out [CSS Tricks' exhaustive guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) for more information tomorrow.

### Day 3: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Did something different today! Taught basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript at a college gamedev workshop. We're building (a simple version of) the Chrome dino game!

**Thoughts:** Teaching code is great fun. Also quite exhausting. Also wrote a crapton of other code today, but unfortunately those have to be in private repositories at the moment.

**Link to work:** Unfortunately, no links today. I'll add the link to the repo when it goes public. My anonymized contributions should be visible on my Github graph, however.

### Day 4: January 7, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Completed [Flexbox Froggy](http://flexboxfroggy.com). Also taught how to make a simple version of the [Chrome Dinosaur Game](https://gitlab.com/mindstormer619/chrome-dino) in a six-hour workshop at MEPCO-Schlenk Engineering College, Sivakasi - TN (India).

**Thoughts:** Even more teaching today! The workshop basically continued from the previous day, and concluded today. Pretty much totally exhausted, so I didn't have much time to learn much more about flexboxes. Flexbox Froggy contains a bit more stuff to it than Flexbox Defense does (see Day 1), so learnt more flex properties (`flex-flow`, `flex-wrap` and `align-content`). Also it contains twice the number of levels, so that's great.

Tomorrow I'm mostly free from commitments, so I'm planning on spending a lot more time working with flexboxes. Also gonna read those guides I've linked earlier.

### Day 5: January 8, 2017 (more like 9th, it's really late right now)

**Today's Progress:** Made that freakin flexbox grid I have been trying to make for SO LONG! Lots of trial-and-error later, I finally got *exactly* what I was looking to create today. 

**Thoughts:** Initially the whole thing was pretty hit-and-miss. I was trying a lot of stuff, and nothing was really looking the way I wanted it to, or used some weird hack that didn't exactly set things correctly. (Technically even now I'm using *one* weird hack, but if you know of a non-hacky way to make something look *square* using plain CSS, please let me know).

But now I think I'm getting the hang of it. And the whole thing's great fun now :smile:

I've quick-hosted the output [here](http://spider.nitt.edu/~darthsid/flextest).

The code is part of [this repository](https://github.com/Mindstormer619/ult-ttt) -- the commit is linked [here](https://github.com/Mindstormer619/ult-ttt/commit/5510ef706ea950e6397d31605fafa2fd22c75b06).

### Day 6: January 9, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Made a full Ultimate Tic Tac Toe grid using flexbox, completing that which I was halfway through yesterday. The grid now looks glorious:

![ULTIMATE TIC TAC TOEEEEEE!!!](http://i.imgur.com/esbh8wC.jpg)

Also more small changes on the server side of things. I'll be using socket.io websockets to communicate between the game players and the server.

**Thoughts:** Truth be told, there wasn't *that* much progress today. Heart was just not in it. Spent most of the day procrastinating over other stuff, so I'm pretty sure I could have finished a lot more in the time I took to do this today had I spent a little more time earlier reading up some prerequisites rather than just winging it along. Tomorrow will be a better day.

I'm pretty sure I'm getting the total hang of flexboxes though. They're super-neat.

A two-player game is a fairly complicated application. I'll have to spend some serious time planning how the client-server interaction works out and how I can minimize the amount of stuff that needs to be done on the server to keep it zipping through games.

**Link to work:** I merged the code back to master in a nice little squashed commit, so it's right at [this commit](ac1ea3d959f0e974dc482e63d854d1eec2b358d4) showing only the nice result and not the PITA trial-and-error I had to do to get here.

OSHIT I JUST REALIZED deleting the PR branch would make some of the previous links I've sent up here moot. I'll see what I can do about it.
